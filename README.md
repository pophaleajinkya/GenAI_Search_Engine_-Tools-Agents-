# GenAI_Search_Engine_-Tools-Agents-

Building a GenAI Search Engine Application with Tools and Agents Using Streamlit as the UI is a project focused on creating an intelligent search engine powered by Generative AI. This application utilizes tools and agents from frameworks like LangChain to enhance search capabilities, while Streamlit provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for end users.

# Key Features:
Generative AI Integration: The search engine leverages advanced language models to generate context-aware and human-like responses to user queries.

Tools and Agents: The application uses agents (autonomous LLMs) that can dynamically select the best tools or models to handle complex search tasks. Tools include knowledge bases, document retrievers, or APIs.

Streamlit UI: A sleek, interactive web-based interface built with Streamlit allows users to easily input search queries, view responses, and interact with the AI.

Multimodal Search: The application can handle multiple data types, including text, documents, and structured data, making it more versatile than traditional search engines.

Enhanced Accuracy: By utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, the search engine provides accurate and relevant responses by retrieving information from vast data sources before generating answers.

This project demonstrates how to harness the power of Generative AI, tools, and agents to build a powerful search solution, with Streamlit offering a simple yet effective UI for users to interact with the search engine in real time.


The below Image is of the initial display page we get when we run the code.
